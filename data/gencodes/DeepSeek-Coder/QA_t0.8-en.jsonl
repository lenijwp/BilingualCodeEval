Essentially you need to count how many unequal element pairs exist in an array.\n\nThe count_Pairs function takes an array as input and counts the number of unequal element pairs. It does this by first counting the frequency of each element in the array. Then it calculates the number of unequal pairs for each element by multiplying the frequency of that element by the number of other elements in the array. It sums these up to get the total number of unequal pairs.
